# Note to fellow developers. 
 Reading "main.py", you will see me calling an empty "print" function, and I'd like to let you know that not using it is somehow messing up the code, making it seem slower.
 I do not know why this is, but if anyone knows what might be happening, I'd be happy to hear your thoughts.
